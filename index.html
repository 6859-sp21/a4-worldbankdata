                <h1>India's growth story since 1960</h1>
           
                
                <p>
                    I downloaded world bank datasets to broadly understand how India has performed over 
                    the years in certain parameters related to economics, education, and science and technology. 
                    These datasets are titled: “economy-and-growth”, “education” and “science-and-technology”. 
                    I do a comparitive assessment of India with its neighbour China, which was in a similar situation
                    in the 60s. <br><br>

                <br><br>
                
                
                </p>
                <p>Note: Please try to zoom in/out to adjust the visualizations to your screen </p>
                
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <p>
                    In early 1990s, both India and China underwent many economic reforms and both have made a huge progress since. However, 
                    the growth in China’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  is much larger than India’s and that naturally begs the question: HOW? <br><br>
                 <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'legend' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>
            <section class = 'step'>
                <svg id = 'legend2' width = '400px' height = '450px'></svg>
                    <br><br>
                The negative correlation does not imply that India’s GDP grows when its net trade of goods is negative. It possibly says that India’s GDP 
                    would’ve been higher had this value been positive. GDP is a complex combination of many factors, some of which have been shown in the 
                    previous plots. However, exported goods did indeed play a big role in China’s massive GDP growth   and India, clearly, is a net importer of goods.

            <section class="step">
                <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <p>
                    Another key factor that was observed was the heavy investment in science and technology. China has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of patents filed
                    since the early 90s. In fact, a positive correlation can be seen between the number of patents filed and the GDP growth over years for some other nations as well.

                <p>
                    I next plotted a sum of total GDP between 2016 and 2017 and a sum of total patents filed between the same period. A positive correlation can again be seen. 
                    Some that stands out is how China has overtaken everyone, highly likely due to its investments in science and technology.

                <p>
                    <h2>Isn't India a better Service economy than China?</h2>
                These plots show that India is better than China in terms of export of ICT services and not services in general. The image about India being better than China is 
                thus built largely upon the ICT sector. However, even in that both India and China are quite closely placed as can be seen.
                </p>
            
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                Finally, I compared similar trends across some other nations to ensure that China and India are not behaving anomalously and similar behavior can be seen in general. 
                This was essential to make logical conclusions from the exploratory analysis. For instance, we can see that the number of patents filed by japan and its GDP curve 
                almost follow the same slope. We also see that as Japan’s net trade in goods dipped a little below zero around 2013-2014, its GDP also dipped. We see a downward trend 
                in Japan’s number of patents filed starting 2005 and we also see a downward trend in the net import of goods by Japan starting 2005. The effects on the economy at large, 
                i.e., GDP are expected to lag this effect as can be somewhat seen in the small but noticeable flattening of slope of Japan’s GDP around 2010. 
                Similar correlations can be seen for the other countries shown in the plot as well.

                <p>
                    The aim is to add at least two interactive charts by the deadline for A4.
                    I would most likely expand this assignment into my final project. I am sure there will be a lot more data on India. ;)
